# Book_Registration_Application
This is a "Book Registration application / Online Book shop Application".
Recently I developed a "Book Registration application / Online Book Shop Application" by using the following stacks.
IDE: Eclipse
Server: Tomcat
Database: MySQL
In the backend part I use Servlet concept, Java Database Connectivity(JDBC).
And in the frontend part I use HTML and bootstrap.
Also use Web annotations as a resource allocation in server.
